     Java Set Interface
        The Set interface is part of the Java Collections Framework 
        is used to store a collection of unique elements.
        Unlike a List, a Set does not allow duplicates, 
        it does not preserve the order of elements (unless you're using TreeSet or LinkedHashSet).
        
        Common classes that implement Set:
        HashSet - fast and unordered
        TreeSet - sorted set
        LinkedHashSet - ordered by insertion

     Data Structure	Stores	Keeps Order?	    Allows Duplicates?	    Best For
     HashSet	            Unique elements	No	No	                    Avoiding duplicates, fast checks

     Interface	Common Classes	                    Description
     Set	    HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet	    Collection of unique elements

     Interface	Class	        Description
     Set	    HashSet	        Unordered collection of unique elements
                TreeSet	        Sorted set of unique elements (natural order)
                LinkedHashSet	Maintains the order in which elements were inserted
