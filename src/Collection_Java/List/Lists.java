     Java List Interface
        The List interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and represents an ordered collection of elements.
        You can access elements by their index, add duplicates, and maintain the insertion order.
        Since List is an interface, you cannot create a List object directly.
        Instead, you use a class that implements the List interface, such as:
        ArrayList - like a resizable array with fast random access
        LinkedList - like a train of cars you can easily attach or remove 

     Data Structure	Stores	Keeps Order?	    Allows Duplicates?	    Best For
     ArrayList	            Ordered elements	Yes	                    Yes	Accessing elements by index

     Interface	Common Classes	                    Description
     List	    ArrayList, LinkedList	            Ordered collection that allows duplicates

     Interface	Class	        Description
