     Java Map Interface
     The Map interface is a part of the Java Collections Framework 
     is used to store key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, but values can be duplicated.
     A Map is useful when you want to associate a key with a value 
     
     Common classes that implement Map:
     HashMap - fast and unordered
     TreeMap - sorted by key
     LinkedHashMap - ordered by insertion

     Data Structure	Stores	Keeps Order?	    Allows Duplicates?	    Best For
     HashMap	            Key-value pairs	No	Yes (keys are unique)	Fast lookup by key

     Interface	Common Classes	                    Description
     Map	    HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap	    Stores key-value pairs with unique keys

     Interface	Class	        Description
     Map	    HashMap	        Stores key/value pairs with no specific order
                TreeMap	        Sorted map based on the natural order of keys
                LinkedHashMap	Maintains the order in which keys were inserted
